  WHAT WE MADE: A Python-coded Telegram Chatbot which 
- Allows user to search for availability carpark lots in a specific area, and return the locations on Google Map
- Makes use of Carpark Availability API as its main data-crawling tool and HDB Carpark Information dataset, 
  both from Data.gov.sg. 
- Contains 2 database systems storing information of users'id, their recent searches and all the available parking lots 

  TO CHAT WITH OUR BOT:
- Simply search for: "CarPark HDB" on Telegram and find the one with 3 eagles as avatar!
- Then press "Start"
- Enter a specific LOCATION
- Press the image to see the location on Google Map
- Time to park a car!
  
  NOTICE:
- We have successfully deploy our bot by heroku!
- How ever, in case you cannot chat with our bot (probably heroku server down), please run CarparkBot.py, then you can talk to the bot!
