  WHAT WE MADE: A Python-coded Telegram Chatbot which 
- Allows user to search for availability carpark lots in a specific area, and return the locations on Google Map
- Makes use of Carpark Availability API as its main data-crawling tool and HDB Carpark Information dataset, 
  both from Data.gov.sg. 
- Contains 2 database systems storing information of users'id, their recent searches and all the available parking lots
